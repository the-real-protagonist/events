# Event Cards

This project displays a series of stylized event cards with images, interactive hover effects, and animated elements. Each card reveals event details such as title, date, venue, and a registration button on hover. A fixed vertical heading adds a creative flair, while a blurred overlay enhances readability against the background. The layout uses modern CSS Grid for responsiveness and clean structure.
